## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


```css
.heading{
  padding-top: 0 !important;
}
```

### Continued development

Little unsure about the use of flexbox and grid display properties in css. I just know to use them in some situation, but what goes behind is still a little cloudy. 

Use of bootstrap should be done more by my side, too limited in this design.
